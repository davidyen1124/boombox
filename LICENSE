                    YO, THIS IS A LICENSE
                    (or whatever)

Look, here's the deal:

1. This is a boombox that doesn't even play music.
   If you want it, it's yours. Go nuts.

2. Things you can do:
   - Everything
   - Seriously, everything
   - Even the stupid stuff

3. The only rules:
   - If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces
   - Don't blame us for your terrible life choices
   - Buy us a coffee if you make millions (yeah, right)

4. Warranty?
   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... no.

That's it. That's the license.
Now go play with those bouncy bars.
